# Various Trivial Diffuers Scripts for Personal Use

Collection of various local use convenience scripts for playing around with diffusers.

## Level of Support Offered

I'll just offer a parable: "When selling a used car, the warrantly ends when the car moves under its own power and the
merchant is able to see the tail lights."

## Development Environment

I'm working on a Debian Bookworm box with an Nvidia RTX A4000.

If you have a functional Python 3.11 installation, `uv run --locked` should have you covered /wrt local setup.

### Editorconfig

* UTF-8
* LF
* Managed whitespace
* Lines are 120 characters long

The line length is inherited by all other configs.

### Formatting

* ruff

### Linting

* ruff
* pymarkdown
* shellcheck

Refer to `pyproject.toml` for details on which linters are enabled and how they are set up.

### Smoketest

The nature of these scripts does not allow for properly checking for correctness of operation and/or output. For this
purpose a manual smoketest script is provided for assessing if any manual version bumps broke anything.

```console
$ ./smoketest.sh

cogvideox.py

### Stable Diffusion Turbo 16bit

* `uv run --locked sd-turbo.py`
* `uv run --locked sd-turbo.py --help`

A fast model, which produces something at a single step. Not terrible, not great.
